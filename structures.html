    Functions
    <br>
    Functions allow code that does a single task to be stored in a block, and allow that task to be called
    many times without having to rewrite the same code. A function can pass data that is operated and return the data.
    Javascript includes functions such as getElementById(), which returns the element object whose id property matches the specified
    string in the parenthesis. For example, if you were to have a h1 tag with the id header in HTML, here is how it would be called in JS:
    <br>
    &lt;h1 id="header"&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;
    <br>
    &lt;script&gt; <br>
    function exampleFunct() { <br>
        const var = document.getElementById("header"); <br>
        *xyz code* <br>
    } <br>
    &lt;/script&gt;
</p>

    Variables
    <br>
    Variables are instances of where an object represents something.
    It is a container for a value, such as a number or a string. Variables
    have to be defined then initialized. Lets say I want to create a variable which
    contains my name. I would declare it as name, then set the value to a string Helen.
    <br>
    let name = "Helen"; <br>
    If I wanted to redeclare the variable to a different value, such as change the name, I would do this:
    <br>
    let name = "Helen"; <br>
    name = "Camila";
    <br>
    Although you can technically name a variable whatever you like, there are general conventions, such as
    only using numbers letters and underscores, camelCase for multiple words, don't start with numbers. 
    Variables also can't be named reserved words, such as let, functon, or for. They are also case sensitive,
    so the variable newData is different from newdata.
